Dear SmFjcXVp,

Over the years since graduation, I've taken a lot of time to reflect on things and myself as a person.  I've made
progress which is good, although there is still a lot of work to do.  One of the things I've realized is that I
have a lot of good and beautiful ideas, but I am often not strong enough to see them through.

One of those beautiful ideas was writing letters to you.  The dedication of writing a letter supporting someone
I cared about once a month sounded great in my mind.  However, in the end I failed to be supportive.  Instead I  
selfishly asked for support from you.

Obviously I don't have the ability to hand-write letters and send them to you anymore, but I want to prove to myself
that I can do it.  That I can selflessly write a letter once a month to someone I care about.  I will post them
in this repository on the first of every month.  I'll write about my life and wish you the best.  And I'll do so
without asking for anything.

This past month was really busy for me.  I spent a lot of time working at my family's Christmas Tree lot.  I worked
every weekend and took some days off during the week.  It's a really nice change of pace from sitting in an office,
although working in the rain/snow/ice isn't super fun :/.  

For Lisa's wedding gift I knitted a blanket.  It was made out of this baby blanket yarn which is super fat and soft,
so it is very comfy.  Hopefully she is enjoying it.  After the wedding I started working on another blanket with the
same type of yarn for my mom.  I had to rush to finish it before Christmas, I spent the majority of a couple days
just knitting.  It wasn't perfect, but I guess that just shows it was made with love.

I also got a new job!  Most of the companies I talked to wanted someone with more experience, but a few gave me a
chance.  Amazon gave me a coding exam in September, which I failed.  I really wasn't prepared enough for the questions.
Nowadays I complete an interview type programming exercise every morning.  I figure that I'll never know when another
opportunity will arise.  I did end up getting a job at Cigna.  I did a bit better on their coding exercises because I
was more prepared.  I'm starting on January 13th.  They have an office right next to Grand Central.  It will be
a big adjustment, but hopefully I'll do okay.  I'll be commuting for a while and maybe in the spring I'll get an 
apartment.

I hope you had a great holiday with family and friends.  It was also your birthday, that must have been exciting!
I'm sure it was a nice day.  I hope work and everything is going well.  You are very smart, so I'm sure you are
doing great :).

Always remember that you are a good person and deserve to be treated well.  I hope you've learned a lot and have
grown as a person even more than me.  Hopefully this letter put a smile on your face.  I will write again soon.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
