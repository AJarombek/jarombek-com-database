Dear SmFjcXVp,

It is starting to feel like fall on certain days, which I love.  It reminds me of Cross Country 
season and the excitement of being around friends again.  I hope your summer has been wonderful and 
you are excited for the coming month.

In August I went back to Riverside once or twice to Kayak and run.  I also zoom called some friends 
from my apartment.  Otherwise it was a pretty low-key month.  I started running workouts again, 
although I don't have any races planned.  My long runs are getting kinda long too, around 12-14 miles.  
It must be the Cross Country weather :).

I don't know if you traveled anywhere or did anything super exciting this summer, but at the very 
least I hope you had some fun!  No matter what you are very loved and cared for.  My love is always 
here for you.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
