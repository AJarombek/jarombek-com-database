Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you had a fun February and that this week was a peaceful one for you.  I just got back from my Ski trip with Tom 
and Joe, it was a ton of fun.  

Not really sure if I'll be doing much besides working in March, but I am very excited for the spring and blooming 
flowers.  I do have one race scheduled for next weekend in Manhattan.  Its a NYRR one mile race, which will definitely 
be challenging due to me not doing enough speed work.  I'm excited for that though.

I hope you are as excited for the spring as I am, it definitely is a peaceful time.  It's a bit silly, but I just like to
walk around and see the flowers starting to poke through the soil.  I guess if you have any hardships this month you can 
try that and see if it helps put your mind at ease.

Just like the flowers I adore, you are truly a beautiful person.  I also know that you are just starting to poke through 
the soil, and have so much room left to grow and flourish.  You will find so much peace within yourself along the way, 
I know you will.  I'm always here for you and will be praying for your happiness and success.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
