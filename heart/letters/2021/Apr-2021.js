Dear SmFjcXVp,

Spring is here and the flowers are starting to bloom.  One of my favorite spots to run is by the Central Park reservoir 
under the cherry blossoms.  So beautiful & heavenly.  No matter what, always puts my mind at peace.

March was mostly just a working month for me.  I did get some races in which was nice.  I was also happy to get to 
watch college basketball this year.  Hopefully things get to a point where there are races regularly in the city that I 
can sign up for.  So far April is looking like another working month, which is okay.

You are an amazing person.  If you haven't already reached the life you wish to live & peace you wish to find, I know 
you will.  Surround yourself with those people you love.  I know you go out of your way to avoid hurting or being a 
burden to those you care for, and trust me you are so loved for that.  Just know that they will always be there for 
you no matter what challenges you come to them with.  That is simply a sign of your kind spirit.

Love is always on your side.  I hope April is filled with happy and exciting times for you.  As always I will be 
praying for your success, growth, and attainment of that which you desire.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
