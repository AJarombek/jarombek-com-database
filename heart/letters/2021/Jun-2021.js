Dear SmFjcXVp,

Summer time is upon us, so hopefully you are ready to enjoy all the warm weather.  Everything outside is so green now 
compared to the last time I wrote.

May was a difficult month for me.  I was sick for the first three weeks and had to stay in my apartment all day.  The 
hardest part was not being able to run, but luckily I'm able to now.  I hope it was a better month for you.  Some good 
news is that I got fully vaccinated and I am releasing the second version of my SaintsXCTF website.

June will probably be a pretty quiet month for me.  If my body cooperates I'll finally get to run NYRR races in Central 
Park at the end of the month & beginning of July.

You are so loved and cared for.  I hope these letters make the world of difference for you that I think they do.  I also 
hope for sunny skies in your life.  You truly deserve that.  I'm always here for you and wishing the best for you.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
