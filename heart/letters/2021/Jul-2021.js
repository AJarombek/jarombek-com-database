Dear SmFjcXVp,

I may not know how things are really going for you, but I hope all is well and you are enjoying the start of your 
summer.  I've mostly been running and continuing with my programming.  I'm really starting to get passionate about 
training for the first time in a long time.  My body is finally able to run decent mileage and handle workouts and 
races without breaking down.  Maybe one of these days I'll be able to run as much as I did in college.  
I'm very at peace with my training progress & racing performance these days, which helps so much.

I hope you are accomplishing the goals you have set out for yourself, and if you miss the mark are not being hard on 
yourself.  Those are simply opportunities to grow.  

I have quite a few races planned this month and am hanging out with Joe and Tom twice.  As always I'll work on getting 
at least one commit of code in each day, it makes me happy and results in me feeling accomplished when I do that.

Maybe I don't know how you are because you are doing so well, and if so that is wonderful and I'm so happy for you.  I 
also know there is a good chance you are still facing a lot of hardship.  Whatever the case may be, I'm always 
here for you.  I know I've said this before but I've always admired your strength.  You are such a great inspiration 
for me in my life, as you are for so many.  You are not alone when facing any challenge, and love & support is always 
by your side.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
