Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you had a merry Christmas and are excited for the next few days.  This month was a pretty busy one for me.  I had
a lot of fun selling Christmas trees.  I got to take a few days off from work to help out as well.  It was really nice
getting to spend time with the extended family that way, especially since we cant spend time together indoors, 
obviously.  Christmas was good too, its always nice to get those extra days off.

I'm not really sure what January will bring, it might just end up being a month where I'm working all the time.  On the 
positive side there are so many programming topics I want to learn, so maybe I'll have some time to explore them.  Its 
better when I have some other activities to provide time away from the work though.

Your special day is almost here, I'm sure you are excited :).  You might not be able to do everything you wish to given 
the circumstances, but I know you will make the most of it.  I hope that your birthday wish comes true and that 2021 is 
your best year yet, you definitely deserve that.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
