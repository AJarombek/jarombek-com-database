Dear SmFjcXVp,

This month was a chaotic one in the world, but hopefully in your life you were able to maintain some peace and 
tranquility.  I hope you had a wonderful time on your special day, you earned it!

January was an interesting month for me.  I spent a lot of time working, but also started ramping up my running again 
and watched Packers games over Zoom with Ben, Joe, & Tom.  Unfortunately I sprained my ankle running back in Greenwich 
during the middle of the month, but I was lucky and only had to take five days off.

I will be praying for a happy and healthy February for you, and one that builds upon accomplishments you've made this 
month.  I'm immediately looking forward to the snow that is in the forecast, I would love to get to cross country ski 
through Central Park a bit.  I'm also running a 5K road race on super bowl sunday, going skiing that friday, and have a 
ski trip to Vermont tentatively planned with Joe & Tom from Feb 24th to Feb 27th.  Hopefully covid doesn't interrupt 
these things!

Although I don't know how things are going for you, I would guess the good is mixed in with the bad.  It always helps 
to hear things again, so I want to remind you that I'm always here for you and that you are so loved.  Also, remember, 
that love is yours no matter what paths you take.  You doing whatever brings you happiness is whats most important.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
