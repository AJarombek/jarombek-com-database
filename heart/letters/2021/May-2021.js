Dear SmFjcXVp,

I always think May is a nice month, where the days are warm and feel like summer at times but the nights are still cool 
and comfortable.  I've been running under those cherry blossoms I mentioned last month, they are so pretty.

I hope you have an excellent month as we gear up for summer and more and more things reopening.  I get the second dose of 
the vaccine on the 9th, so that will be nice.  It might not change my day to day activity much but will be such a 
comforting reassurance.  Otherwise I don't have much planned this coming month besides for a 5K race in CT this weekend.

I sense a lot of emotional & spiritual growth in you, and for that I'm so happy for you.  That is what you have wanted 
for a long time.  If you haven't already, I hope that May is the month where you are able to take that leap towards the 
love you truly desire.  You are ready and so deserving.  I love you, always.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
