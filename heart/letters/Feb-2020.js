Dear SmFjcXVp,

As promised, here I am writing you a letter for this month.  I hope this past month was beautiful, 
therapeutic, and filled with growth for you.  I'm sure things are going well, and I'm very proud 
of you for all your accomplishments.  Hopefully you now see yourself as the amazing person that 
I and the others who truly care for you see you as.

I've been doing my best to work very hard this month.  I started my new job a few weeks back and am 
getting accustomed to the new role.  I'm getting to learn a lot of new technologies which is cool.  
I'll start writing articles about those technologies soon (I need to read the books and write the 
code first!).  Hopefully you found your secret message in the React code, its article will be out 
soon.  I'm sorry its not much, you deserve more.

Otherwise I went skiing up in Mass, began knitting a new blanket, and ran a few more races.  I wish
there was more snow, it doesn't really feel like winter outside.  I haven't been able to use the
nordic skis at all.

Anyway, enough about me :).  I hope this February is your best month yet.  Continue pursuing 
whatever makes you happy.  I will always send my prayers and best wishes your way.  Dotty, Lily, 
and Grandmas blanket support you and bring you comfort from afar.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
