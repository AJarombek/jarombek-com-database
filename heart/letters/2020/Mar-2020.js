Dear SmFjcXVp,

Last month I told you that I wished it would be your best month yet.  Hopefully that came true and
March will be even better.  I'm sure you are doing well, which makes me very happy.

Things are going pretty well with me, I'm liking my new job a lot.  I'm not used to all the 
commuting, so sometimes that does take a bit of a toll on me.  I'm trying to run some races, which 
is fun.  The results are pretty mixed, I don't have much speed anymore.

Although I'm sure your life is going great and you are spending it with those you love, in case you
hit some bumps in the road I want to remind you of a few things.  First is how loved you are, not
just by me but by so many people.  Take comfort in that fact during a tough time.  Those who love you
will always be routing for you and will never judge you.  I know I've said that many times, but I
think its important to remind you so that you know its still true.

Second is that there are always people ready and willing to help you no matter what.  Hopefully you
have used the love and guidance of those you care for over these years.  And finally of course is
that myself and all the others who love you will always feel this way and be here for you.  You never
have to worry about that.

I hope the end of winter and beginning of spring brings you even more joy and happiness.  You are 
such an amazing person, I am confident at this point you know that of yourself as much as I do.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
