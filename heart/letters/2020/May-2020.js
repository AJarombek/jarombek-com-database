Dear SmFjcXVp,

Happy May!  It's been a very rainy and cool April, but things will get warmer and more sunny.  I 
hope you are doing okay with everything going on around us, it can be hard to take at times.  You 
are not alone.

Unsurprisingly this was another strange month for me.  It was definitely challenging at times.  The 
flowers blooming outside are helping my spirits though.  I've been ordering some furniture for my 
apartment which is fun.  I got some really cool knitted pillows and have a couch, rug, & table 
arriving this month.  The rug is probably the coolest of the bunch, its handmade in India.  I 
finished knitting my third blanket this afternoon as well.  I'm giving it to my grandmother when I 
have the chance to, although who knows when that will be these days.  Maybe my mom or aunt will 
drop it off.  I'm already planning the next blanket. The yarn is alpaca, which is kinda cool.  It's 
coming in from Estonia next week (I dont know if its actually made there though).  I'm trying my 
best to stay occupied.

I'm sure you are trying to stay occupied and happy as well.  Let the knowledge that you are always 
very loved be your light in dark times.  Remember that you are a great person (I wanted to underline 
"great" but you can't do that in a JavaScript file).  Remember that you deserve to be treated with 
love and respect and care.  Now, in the past, and forever.

Dotty and Lily say hi and give you big hugs from afar.  They really do help me out, and you know 
much of that is thanks to you.  Give your little stuffed friend lots of big hugs if you can.

Thank you for being such a great inspiration and kind soul.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
