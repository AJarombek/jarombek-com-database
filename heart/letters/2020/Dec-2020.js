Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you had a nice Thanksgiving break and November was kind to you.  I hope you are excited for the holidays.  We
are also just a month away from your special day!  I'm sure there will be lots of happy times for you in the coming 
weeks.

November really flew by for me.  I ran a nice scenic 8.5 mile race up in Kent, CT during the middle of the month.  My 
shins have been hurting a good amount but they've been improving and loosen up once I start running.  I've done some 
cross training on the Citi bikes to compensate for the lost running time, which is kinda funny. 

We also unloaded all the Christmas trees this past weekend.  Unfortunately, after lugging trees in the back of a tractor 
trailer for a few minutes my mask got soaking wet and it got hard to breathe.  Luckily that shouldn't be too much of an 
issue while selling the trees (unless it rains a lot).

This month I'll spend the first two or three weekends back in CT helping sell trees, which I always enjoy.  I hope that 
you have some fun holiday traditions that you will still get to do.  While I don't know what challenges you face these 
days, I do know how great of a person you are.  I have nothing but love for you and your kind soul.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
