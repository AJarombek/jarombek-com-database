Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you are healthy and doing well.  This month has been a challenging one and next month is 
looking similar.  Make sure to keep faith and smile when you can :).  There are beautiful things 
in the world and wonderful acts of kindness all around us.

March was mentally pretty exhausting for me.  Even for someone who is an expert at social 
distancing (ha) and spending time alone, this has been rough.  Knowing how extroverted you are 
and how much you love spending time meeting and being around others, I'm guessing its been 
challenging for you.  Hopefully you are finding ways to keep your loved ones close to you.  I'm 
sure you are still able meet new people and pursue the love you desire, which is good :).

I just wanted to share my challenges this month so that you know you aren't alone if you are 
feeling the same.  I don't want you to worry about me at all, I'll be okay on my own.  I have Dotty 
and Lily and Grandma's Blanket for company.

One big thing that happened was I moved to NYC.  Kinda terrible timing in retrospect, but I'm 
trying to make the best of the situation.  In case you are curious, my address is 
15 West 64th Street Apt #4B.  Dotty, Lily, and I are learning how to operate on our own.  It's gone 
pretty well so far, I'm cleaning a lot which I'm sure you would be surprised by lol.

I will send a prayer your way every night, wishing you and you loved ones health and happiness. 
Always remember that no matter what you do, no matter who you love and spend your life 
with, you are so very loved.  If you do read these, hopefully they help you and make you happy.  
That is my intent when writing them.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
