Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope your summer is going well and you've been able to do some fun things despite everything 
going on.  I got a chance to visit Joe up in New Hampshire and go kayaking and running back in 
Greenwich.  We also got a new T-Swift album which is always fun :).

At work I was put onto a new team, and so far it hasn't been too much fun.  I'm the only person who 
knows front-end development so all the work (including teammates work) is falling on my plate.  
Hopefully things will get better, and I hope you are having a better experience in that regard.

As always, I want you to know how great of a person you are.  You deserve the best.  Continue to 
pursue that which makes you happy and stand by those you love.  I know sometimes in the past you 
didn't think highly of yourself, but I hope that has changed.  If you are still figuring that out I 
wish for my words of encouragement and love to help.

You are deserving of love, now & forever.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
