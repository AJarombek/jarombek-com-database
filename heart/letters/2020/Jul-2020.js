Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you had a fun and exciting June.  The month really flew by for me, not really sure why since 
the previous few months felt really slow.  I finally got all my furniture set up which is pretty 
cool.  Otherwise looking back it was kinda an uneventful month for me.  Maybe July will bring a bit 
more excitement.

As always, I hope you are being treated with the kindness and love you deserve.  I pray that  
those challenging times are behind you.  If not I hope your loved ones are able to shine light and 
love on you when things are most difficult.  After all, you are always very loved.

Usually I know exactly what I want to say when it comes time to write these.  This time my mind 
isn't so sure what to do.  So until I find the right words, I will just say that my love is always 
here for you.  

Take good care of yourself, you deserve it.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
