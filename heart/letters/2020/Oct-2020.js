Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you are doing well and you & your loved ones are in good health.  September has been an 
interesting month.  I actually ran a race at the Armory, although it felt a bit more like we were 
lab mice testing out how to have a Track meet during Covid.  I ran an 800m in lane four with one 
other person in lane one.  It was a very slow 800m, you would have kicked my butt :).

Otherwise I mostly just tried to work hard, run a lot, and go for walks outside as much as I 
could.  I'm definitely excited for sweater weather, but also trying to take advantage of the last 
few summer-like days.

I'm not really sure what to say this month, but I hope that is a sign you are happy and on a path 
you are enjoying!  No matter what the case is you are always loved, of course.

I'm guessing this next month or so will bring a good amount of stress to us all, so make sure to take 
time to yourself and do that which you love.  And make sure to spend some time with the fall leaves :).

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
