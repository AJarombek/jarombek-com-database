Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope all is well and that you are happy and healthy :).  I wish for things to go the way you want them to this month.
Continue to enjoy the fall and the colorful leaves all around.

October was mostly uneventful for me but I did get some races in.  I ran a virtual NYRR 5 mile race two weekends ago and 
just got back from running a trail 10K with Joe & Tom up in Farmington CT.  It was a lot of fun, although unfortunately 
Ben couldn't make it.  I'm probably going to take a few days to relax the legs and then try to run another trail race 
and virtual race this coming month.

Remember that you are loved no matter what life path you are taking.  I am always here for you and happy to help.  I 
hope you have a wonderful month, get to enjoy a great Thanksgiving, and you and your little bear friend stay cozy & warm 
as the temperatures continue to go down.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
