Dear SmFjcXVp,

I hope you are doing well and are safe and healthy.  And that your loved ones are safe and healthy 
as well.  Challenging times often bring out the best in us, and I know they will bring out the best 
in you.

Continue to support the causes and people you care so deeply about.  Your love and support for the 
good and kind people around you is powerful, and will not go unnoticed.  I've believed for a 
long time that being kind and supportive to people we encounter in life, even if we cant fully 
grasp the challenges they face, can have an incredibly powerful impact.  I haven't always been 
perfect at that, but I try my best.

I'm continuing to put together my apartment, I have a couch coming this month.  I'm really excited 
for that since my living room will mostly be completed when it arrives.  I still run in the park 
every morning.  I went for more than 10 miles this morning for the first time in quite a while.  My 
family stopped by for a walk in the park a weekend or two ago which was really nice.

Otherwise the job is going well and I'm trying my best to code a good amount in my spare time.  One 
of the prototypes I'm really excited to work on is a web page that sells flowers from my families 
garden (not actually for sale, of course).  I wish I had another 12 hours in a day to work on stuff.

You are a wonderful person, deserving of all the love that life has to offer.  I know I've said that 
so many times already, but its true!  You are amazing, flaws and all.  Don't let anyone try to trick 
you into thinking otherwise.

Peace, Love, & Happiness,
Andy
