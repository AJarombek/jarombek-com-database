    I didn't realize it when I met you in August 2013, but I had already fallen in love with you.  I was scared of my 
    feelings that I didn't yet understand at the time, a theme which continued on throughout the years.  My fears caused 
    me to shut you out, because I didn't know how to deal with my feelings without getting love in return.  When you 
    burst back into my life two and a half years later, it felt like all my prayers had been answered.  It turns out neither of us 
    were ready for a love between us.  I went back to shutting you out, but that only caused me more pain.  The greatest 
    failure of my life was letting that pain reach you.  Nowadays I try to learn how to control my love and use it 
    positively.  I will always love you.  I will always be here for you.  You are always in my heart.  I hope one day 
    that my love can have a positive impact on this world, and if that happens it will be thanks to you.
    
    I will love you always - my bound 2 listening, wine stain cleaning, letter writing, talking until 5am, friend.

    I hope she knows how unconditionally loved she is.  Forever and always.  I also hope she 
    realizes that she deserves every last bit of that love.  You inspire me, thank you for being 
    your wonderful self.
