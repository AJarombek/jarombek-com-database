    I didn't realize it when I met you in August 2013, but I had already fallen in love with you.  I was scared of my 
    feelings that I didn't yet understand at the time, a theme which continued on throughout the years.  My fears caused 
    me to shut you out, because I didn't know how to deal with my feelings without getting love in return.  When you 
    burst back into my life two and a half years later, it felt like all my prayers had been answered.  It turns out neither of us 
    were ready for a love between us.  I went back to shutting you out, but that only caused me more pain.  The greatest 
    failure of my life was letting that pain reach you.  Nowadays I try to learn how to control my love and use it 
    positively.  I will always love you.  I will always be here for you.  You are always in my heart.  I hope one day 
    that my love can have a positive impact on this world, and if that happens it will be thanks to you.
    
    I will love you always - my bound 2 listening, wine stain cleaning, letter writing, talking until 5am, friend.

    What I know is that I care for you.  And that the universe seems to be telling me to try my best 
    to be here for you.  For a long time I've been working on myself, partially so that if you ever 
    return for whatever your reason I will be ready to be the strong, supportive person I failed to 
    be in the past.
    
    I'm sorry that things have been this way between us.  I hope you are finding all the things you 
    desire.  If I'm still on that list, hopefully you know there is nothing to fear.  I am here for 
    you.  If you want a break from your quest and the silence between us, I am here.  Even if it's 
    just for a day or an hour.  I don't want you to feel sad because you don't think you can speak 
    to me.  I'll be on your side if you ever decide to.  I will make time for you.
    
    Thank you for the happiness you bring to my world.  I know that things are very delicate, I'm
    trying my best to say the right things.  With Love, Andy
