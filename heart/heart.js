    I didn't realize it when I met you in August 2013, but I had already fallen in love with you.  I was scared of my 
    feelings that I didn't yet understand at the time, a theme which continued on throughout the years.  My fears caused 
    me to shut you out, because I didn't know how to deal with my feelings without getting love in return.  When you 
    burst back into my life two and a half years later, it felt like all my prayers had been answered.  It turns out neither of us 
    were ready for a love between us.  I went back to shutting you out, but that only caused me more pain.  The greatest 
    failure of my life was letting that pain reach you.  Nowadays I try to learn how to control my love and use it 
    positively.  I will always love you.  I will always be here for you.  You are always in my heart.  I hope one day 
    that my love can have a positive impact on this world, and if that happens it will be thanks to you.
    
    I will love you always - my bound 2 listening, wine stain cleaning, letter writing, talking until 5am, friend.

    I want to write this in case someone is still being mean to her.  She is a wonderful person.  
    I pray for her to continue having strength despite all the adversity.  I feel so reassured that 
    she has great friends looking out for her after seeing a friend supporting her just over a month ago.  
    She is so loved, I hope she knows that.  I hope I am doing enough for her.  If there is anything 
    else I can do to support and help, just let me know or have someone tell me.  No matter what you 
    decide to do, you will always have my full love and support.  I hope you have a more peaceful 
    road ahead, my love.
