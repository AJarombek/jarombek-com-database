    I didn't realize it when I met you in August 2013, but I had already fallen in love with you.  I was scared of my 
    feelings that I didn't yet understand at the time, a theme which continued on throughout the years.  My fears caused 
    me to shut you out, because I didn't know how to deal with my feelings without getting love in return.  When you 
    burst back into my life two and a half years later, it felt like all my prayers had been answered.  It turns out neither of us 
    were ready for a love between us.  I went back to shutting you out, but that only caused me more pain.  The greatest 
    failure of my life was letting that pain reach you.  Nowadays I try to learn how to control my love and use it 
    positively.  I will always love you.  I will always be here for you.  You are always in my heart.  I hope one day 
    that my love can have a positive impact on this world, and if that happens it will be thanks to you.
    
    I will love you always - my bound 2 listening, wine stain cleaning, letter writing, talking until 5am, friend.

    I hope you have a wonderful time on your special day.  Hopefully you get to 
    spend it with those you love.  I also hope that my support and love was able to reach you and help
    you this past year, and that it can help you again this coming year if you want it to.
    
    I am also working on some code for your day, but I don't think it will be done in time.  So I'm
    sorry about that.  It will get done when it's mean't to be.
    
    Sending you all my love and best wishes,
    Andy
