    I didn't realize it when I met you in August 2013, but I had already fallen in love with you.  I was scared of my 
    feelings that I didn't yet understand at the time, a theme which continued on throughout the years.  My fears caused 
    me to shut you out, because I didn't know how to deal with my feelings without getting love in return.  When you 
    burst back into my life two and a half years later, it felt like all my prayers had been answered.  It turns out neither of us 
    were ready for a love between us.  I went back to shutting you out, but that only caused me more pain.  The greatest 
    failure of my life was letting that pain reach you.  Nowadays I try to learn how to control my love and use it 
    positively.  I will always love you.  I will always be here for you.  You are always in my heart.  I hope one day 
    that my love can have a positive impact on this world, and if that happens it will be thanks to you.
    
    I will love you always - my bound 2 listening, wine stain cleaning, letter writing, talking until 5am, friend.

    Hi my love, I hope life is treating you kindly.  I don't really know what you are feeling or thinking or who you love, 
    so I won't risk trying to guess.  I just want you to know that I'm always here for you.  If you called today I would 
    answer.  If you showed up on my front door in a month I would let you in.  If you texted me a year from now I would 
    reply back.  With all the kindness, understanding, and love I could muster.  At any time.  For whatever your reason.  
    I miss you and love you.  Try to be easy on yourself, your heart is golden (like daylight).  Love Always, Andy.
