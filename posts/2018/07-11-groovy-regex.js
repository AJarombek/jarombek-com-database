Groovy simplifies Java's regular expression functionality - which itself it very flexible albeit a bit verbose.  Groovy's use of operators for regular expression compilation and execution phases puts the language in a very unique position.  The inclusion of regular expressions in Groovy's operators - the most basic actions of the language - sets the tone for Groovy's intentions for simplifying regular expressions. ",
