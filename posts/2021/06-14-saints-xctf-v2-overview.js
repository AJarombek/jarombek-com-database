In college I wasn't aware of these libraries, so JQuery was a logical starting point.  An additional problem with the UI code was the stylesheet.  The UI consisted of one single CSS file for the entire application.  This resulted in hard to identify styling issues, especially when adding new styles to one page negatively impacted another page.  Once again, modern CSS preprocessors and CSS in JavaScript libraries have greatly improved the modularity of stylesheets as modern frameworks and libraries have for JavaScript code. ",

I was reinventing the wheel without realizing it.  Another issue with the API was that it shared the same codebase and build process (a manual SFTP upload to the linux server) as the front-end code.  This meant if the website went down, the API would as well.  If new UI code was deployed, the API was redeployed as well.
